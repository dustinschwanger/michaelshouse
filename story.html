                        <p>This center was established in memory of Michael Wasserman, whose tragic story reminds us why child advocacy centers are essential to protecting children and seeking justice.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>At age three, Michael Wasserman was an innocent, loving child with a future full of hope. He ran and played and had the potential to fill the world with joy. Tragically his life was cut short when he was murdered by his mother's live-in boyfriend.</p>

                        <p>The autopsy report and expert medical testimony at trial established that Michael suffered scalding burns to his lower extremities as well as numerous bruises and abrasions over his tiny body. After suffering for three to five days with these injuries, Michael died of sepsis (blood poisoning).</p>

                        <p>All those associated with this case, including paramedics, trauma nurses, and law enforcement, were traumatized and forever changed as a result of this tragic case. Reports covering the investigation and trial shocked the community.</p>

                        <p>The boyfriend was convicted of murder and remains in prison. Michael's mother was convicted of numerous felony offenses, including manslaughter and spent fifteen years in prison.</p>

                        <div class="quote-block">
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>"I cannot rest knowing Michael's cries went alone. The system failed Michael, and there is nothing I can do about that now other than to say may he rest in peace. Justice cries out for punishment in this case as loud as your child cried out in pain."</p>
                                <cite>— Judge James McMonagle</cite>
                            </blockquote>
                        </div>

                        <p>The system failure that Judge McMonagle was referring to was the fact that Michael was removed from the home less than five months before he was murdered because the same live-in boyfriend was suspected of abusing Michael. Inexplicably, Michael was placed back in the home where he suffered an unimaginably painful death just three weeks later.</p>
