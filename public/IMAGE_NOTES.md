# Image Requirements for Michael's House Website

## Images Needed

The following images need to be added to the `/public` directory:

### Homepage Card Grid (referenced in index.html)
1. **michaels-story-placeholder.jpg** - Image for Michael's Story card
   - Suggested: A respectful memorial-style image or abstract hopeful image
   - Dimensions: 600x400px minimum

2. **resources-placeholder.jpg** - Image for Resources card
   - Suggested: Image representing support/helping hands or community resources
   - Dimensions: 600x400px minimum

3. **help-placeholder.jpg** - Image for "How You Can Help" card
   - Suggested: Image with text "Make a Difference" or hands holding heart
   - Dimensions: 600x400px minimum

### Homepage Goals Section
4. **goals-placeholder.jpg** - Background image for goals section
   - Suggested: Soft, abstract image or child in supportive environment
   - Should be subtle as it will have low opacity (0.3)
   - Dimensions: 800x800px minimum

## Images Already Provided

✓ **logo.png** - Michael's House logo (header and footer)
✓ **insidehouse1.jpg through insidehouse9.jpg** - Interior photos for About page gallery

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: JPG for photos, PNG for logos with transparency
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web (aim for under 200KB per image)
- **Accessibility**: All images have alt text already defined in HTML
- **Style**: Images should be warm, hopeful, and professional
- **Avoid**: Stock photos that look staged; images showing identifiable children's faces

## Optional: Hero Section
The hero section currently uses CSS gradient overlay. You can optionally add:
- A subtle background image of bubbles (matching original site)
- Abstract hopeful imagery (sunrise, nature, gentle abstract patterns)
- If adding, name it **hero-background.jpg** and update index.html line 65

## Quick Fix: Temporary Solution
Until proper images are sourced, the site will display:
- Placeholder references (images won't break the layout)
- The inside house photos will display correctly on About page
- Consider using solid color placeholders or abstract SVG patterns
