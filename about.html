        <section class="section intro-section">

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Some of the most difficult criminal cases to investigate and prosecute are those involving the physical and/or sexual abuse of children, sometimes as young as two or three, because many times the only witnesses are the victim and the perpetrator. Therefore, one of the key pieces of evidence in a child sexual abuse case is the initial interview of the child victim.</p>

                    <p>It is vital that these initial interviews be conducted by investigators who are trained in forensic interviewing techniques so that the integrity of any disclosures by the child can be maintained. Often, perpetrators will attempt to minimize, deny, or otherwise attempt to discredit the child's statements, thus necessitating the need for interviews to be conducted using accepted forensic methods. Moreover, to limit trauma to a child victim, it is always preferable to conduct only one appropriately formatted interview.</p>

                    <p>To this end, Michael's House, established in honor of child victim Michael Wasserman, was opened in 2005. Michael's House provides a child-friendly environment in which these sensitive interviews can be conducted and recorded with elaborate video equipment. In the past, children were typically interviewed in the cold and sterile atmosphere of a police precinct and be exposed to surrounding that did nothing but amplify the horrible experience of being a child victim of abuse. In contrast, through forensic interviews at Michael's House, children are more at ease in discussing abuse that may have occurred.</p>
